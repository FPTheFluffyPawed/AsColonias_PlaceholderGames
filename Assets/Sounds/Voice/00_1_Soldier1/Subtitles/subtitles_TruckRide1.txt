But of course, what were you expecting? We're not bananas like the ones from Sporting...

00:00:08 --> 00:00:16
Bananas? Laugh, laugh, you'll see how they bite. This is the year of Sporting, your team next to ours are like primary school children.

00:00:16 --> 00:00:25
Look at this, oh Ferro, what have you been smoking? Did Sporting ever threaten Benfica's title? Cure yourself, man! Don't you think, Sampaio?

<color=yellow>Eh, don't drag me into this, you know I barely care about soccer.</color>

00:00:29 --> 00:00:48
Oh Sampaio, I heard you listen to some Sporting matches on the radio, don't pretend you don't care... Boys, you know what, let's go hunting later. Let's see if we get a boar for dinner, it's been a while since we ate good food at base.

Ah, sure Sargent! I was getting tired of that river fish, missing some good protein. Corporal Murta is gonna have a lot of work in the kitchen today.
