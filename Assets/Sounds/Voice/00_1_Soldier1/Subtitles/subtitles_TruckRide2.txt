How did that end up there? No trees around here are big enough to fall down like it's nothing...

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
Don't know, could have fallen off a truck, somebody might have been transporting wood...

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:19
Don't think so... Smells like a trap to me. Keep those eyes and ears open.

4
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
Are those gunshots!?

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:19
It's an ambush!

6
00:00:11 --> 00:00:19
Grab your guns and get out!
