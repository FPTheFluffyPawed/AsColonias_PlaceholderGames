So, Corporal Sampaio, any news from the city about your brother?

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13
Still nothing, my sergeant... Haven't received news about my family for almost three weeks.

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19
Cheer up, your brother should be better. Today this afternoon we received a few aerograms, must be something for you there.

00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
By God's will, sergeant, by God's will...

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
It's an ambush!
